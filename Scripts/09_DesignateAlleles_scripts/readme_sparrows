Classifying derived sites from a big multi-sample vcf into two categories:
house Derived
Spanish Derived

Classifying italian alleles from a big multi-sample vcf file into four categories:
house Derived
Spanish Derived
house Ancestral
Spanish Ancestral

Categorizing loci/site
----------------------------------

Rules for skipping loci:

1. If 50 % or more of Spanish sparrows lack calls, skip locus.
2. If 50 % or more of House sparrows lack calls, skip locus.
3. If 50 % or more of Tree sparrows lack calls, skip locus.
4. If more than two alleles are called, skip locus.
5. If locus is bi-allelic, and if Tree sparrows' minor allele count is >1 (default), skip locus.
6. If no italian sparrows were classifed House or Spanish, skip locus.


Rules for classifying loci:

1. If locus is bi-allelic, and the first allele's Spanish frequency is >0.9 (default), and House frequency is <0.1 (default), allele
	is Spanish and vice versa.
2. If locus is bi-allelic, and the Tree sparrows' max allowed minor allele count is 1 (default), their major allele is Ancestral, and their minor allele is Derived.
